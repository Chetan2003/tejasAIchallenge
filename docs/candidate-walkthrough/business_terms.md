# Business terms

Order approval status is `DRAFT`, `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `REAPPROVAL_REQUIRED`, or `CANCELLED`. Shipment status is `LOADING`, `DISPATCHED`, `DELIVERED`, or `VOIDED`.

Order fulfillment is a separate quantity-derived view: `UNFULFILLED`, `LOADING`, `PARTIALLY_DISPATCHED`, `DISPATCHED`, `PARTIALLY_DELIVERED`, `DELIVERED`, or `CANCELLED`. Payment, credit, and reward balances can coexist; they are not exclusive order states.

## Roles and actions

Admin can perform every listed action. The role column lists the other permitted roles. Every active signed-in role can read CRM customer, order, and account records. Action traces are restricted to the requester, acting staff member, or Admin.

Sales means `SALES`; KAM means Key Account Manager (`KAM`); Warehouse means `WAREHOUSE`; Accounts means `ACCOUNTS`; Admin means `ADMIN`.

Only Admin manages staff roles/status or chooses another active acting staff member. Both actor and signed-in requester are recorded. Customer creation and staff administration use the signed-in user. Public registration creates Sales accounts. An administrator cannot change their own role/status or remove the last active administrator; role/status changes revoke the target's sessions.

## Operation boundary

The listed CRM commands use the action endpoint. Customer creation is a separate endpoint. There is no Sales return-request stage, general receipt-edit action, or arbitrary historical shipment editor. A payment can only be moved whole to another customer (**ACC-004**), and a delivery confirmation can only be lowered (**WF-006**). Refund reversal and authorized extra-goods correction have the specific meanings above. Refunds record bookkeeping; they do not initiate bank transfers.
