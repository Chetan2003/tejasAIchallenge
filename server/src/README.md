# Backend modules

`AppModule` imports feature modules directly. Each directory owns a specific business capability or supporting concern; its README describes the relevant files, collaborators, and execution boundary.

| Directory                                     | Responsibility                                                                                                                           |

## Organization

Business modules keep models, typed repositories, services, controllers, and Nest wiring together. Repository provider modules expose data access where another domain needs it without introducing circular service dependencies. Services coordinate changes; models hold state and value invariants; repositories persist typed records.

Use only the layers a capability needs. Catalog serves repository reads directly. Workspace serves static metadata without a repository or service. Health has one infrastructure query. CRM Queries combines existing reads without inventing a model, repository, or command facade.

Domain commands enter through Actions, which owns transaction/savepoint boundaries, idempotency, version advancement, and pre-commit review. Bootstrap and customer snapshot reads are composed by CRM Queries inside read transactions. Shared request and response contracts are imported from `@crm/shared`; database tooling discovers domain tables through `database/schema.ts`.
